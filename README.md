# ASQLi
ASQLi is a library written to facilitate intereactions with MySQL, MariaDB and SQLite databases. This library simplifies loading rows into php classes, adds support for types such as JSON and allows for loading BLOBs as streams.

## Usage
Using ASQLi is simple! To get started, the ASQLi\Connection class has some static methods that can create connections to different databases such as Mysql/Mariadb and SQLite. We'll work with SQLite in this example.

The following code will create a SQLite instance in memory, create a table and insert some unsafe data in it.

```php
    use ASQLi\Connection;

    $Connection = Connection::SQLite();

    $Connection -> Connect();

    $Connection -> Query("CREATE TABLE test (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, data TEXT);");
    $Connection -> Query("INSERT INTO test (data) VALUES (?);", false, "Some unsafe data! \"; DROP ALL TABLES; SELECT \"");

    $Result = $Connection -> Query("SELECT * FROM test");
    $Data = $Result -> GetRow();

    print_r($Data);

    $Connection -> Disconnect();
```
